Q A-1a : Can you implement the sing() method for the bird?

Answer: No. There is no sing() method is implemented either in Animal or Bird class.so when the code compile will get an error(The method sing() is undefined for the type Bird).

Q A-1b :How did you optimize the code for maintainability? 
Answer : Separate varying behaviours from class to interface..for example all birds can not fly like chicken. so birds which are flyable can implement Flyable interface fly method.
